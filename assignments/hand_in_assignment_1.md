# Hand-in assignment #1
This document describe the first hand-in assignment for the course _T-511-TGRA_. In this assignment you will be writing windowed application so please write them using either LibGDX or in C/C++ using the OpenGL api.

## The Project
In this project please write three applications that work as follows.

1.  Make a windowed desktop application that displays a box.  Make the box move at an even speed diagonally.  If the box hits the edges of the window, make it change direction as if it's bouncing.  If it hits the top of the screen, only change the up-down direction and so on.

2.  Make a windowed desktop application that displays a box.  Make the box move around the screen when you hold down the arrow keys.  Dont let it exit the screen.  When it hits the edge make it stop.

3.  Make a windowed desktop application that displays a blank screen.  When you click with the mouse on the screen display a box centered at the point you clicked on.  Each time you click the screen add a new box.  Every frame you have to display all the boxes, so you have to keep track of them the whole time. Only one box should be created for each click.

You can do this in three projects or one project with three starter classes or maybe the simplest way is to do it all in one program with all the functionality combines, one moving box, one input box (different color) and then a box for each click too.  Pack all the projects, with the source code, into a single archive (zip or rar) and return through the course website or send them via email (hlynurs@ru.is).
